## Golang JWT-SecureCookie HTTP Web REST Project Starter

Simple golang starter project (clone and use as the base for a REST web service) that uses JWT and secure cookies for session authentication.

### Libraries

```
  "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"
  "github.com/gorilla/handlers"
  "github.com/gorilla/mux"
  "github.com/gorilla/securecookie"
``` 

I use `gb` for vendoring so its `gb vendor fetch ` each of the above. 


### TODO 

  - add https
